# Interactive Neural Network Fun inÂ Excel

This code accompanies the medium article https://medium.com/8bad2b3a5d9d.

It shows how it is possible to construct neural networks with PyTorch in Excel using PyXLL.

To try out the code, add the included pyxll.cfg file to your own pyxll.cfg file, by adding
it to the "external_config" setting in the PYXLL section. Alternatively, simply add the
`pytorch_abstract_art` module to your list of modules and ensure it's on your Python path.
