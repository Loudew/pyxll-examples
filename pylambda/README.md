# PyLambda

An example showing how to build new Excel functions using Python expressions
declared as data in an Excel workbook.

Inspired by the standard LAMBDA function added to Excel 365, but using Python
expressions instead of an Excel formula.

Defining functions in an Excel workbook shouldn't be considered "best practice" as
it limits the ability to test and version control code, but being able to
evaluate Python expressions entered in Excel may be useful when used sparingly!

See pylambda.xlsx in this folder for example usage.
